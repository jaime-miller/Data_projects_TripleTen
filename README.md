## Project 4: Conversion Funnel and Cohort Analysis

### Part 1: Build a Conversion Funnel

The executive team was interested in understanding how well the website is converting product page views into purchases. My first job was to create a conversion funnel to better understand how users interact with the website.

### Steps:
1. Using data from the ‚Äúraw_user_activity‚Äù sheet, created a funnel in a pivot table called ‚Äúconversion_funnel‚Äù.
2. Counted unique users for each stage of the funnel.
3. Created columns for total conversion rates and conversion rates to the next step.

### Part 2: Prepare Data for Cohort Analysis

The company wanted to build acquisition cohorts based on the month of a user‚Äôs first purchase and track cohort metrics month by month.

### Steps:
1. Filtered purchases from the ‚Äúraw_user_activity‚Äù sheet into a new sheet called ‚Äúpurchase_activity‚Äù.
2. Calculated first purchase dates and added them to the purchase data.
3. Created columns for event_month, first_purchase_month, and cohort_age.

### Part 3: Calculate Retention Rates

Aggregated purchase data into cohorts and calculated retention rates for each cohort month by month.

### Steps:
1. Grouped data into cohorts in a pivot table called ‚Äúcohort_analysis‚Äù.
2. Calculated retention rates and organized them in a new sheet called ‚Äúretention_rates‚Äù.

### Part 4: Organize and Document the Spreadsheet

Applied best practices to ensure the project looked polished and professional.

### Steps:
1. Summarized results and analysis descriptions in an ‚ÄúExecutive Summary‚Äù sheet.

1. Analyzed the highest return rate products and customers using a calculated field for returns.
2. Visualized average profit against return rates to decide which aspects of the business to focus on.

## Project 6: Storytelling with Data - Analyzing SuperStore Returns

### Part 1: What is Causing Returns?

1. Created various visualizations to identify root causes of returned orders, such as:
   - Scatterplot of total sales vs. total returns by product subcategory.
   - Bar chart of return rate by product category.
   - Return rate by customer with a filter for customers with more than one order.
   - Geographic map of return rates.
   - Return rates over time.
   - Composite charts for multiple factors.

### Part 2: Building a Dashboard for Monitoring Returns
