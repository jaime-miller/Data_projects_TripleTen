# Saving SuperStore - Data Visualization Project

## Project Overview

This project was completed using Tableau and focuses on analyzing the operations of a fictional superstore to increase its profitability and avoid bankruptcy. The project involves identifying profit and loss centers, assessing the value of advertising, and analyzing returned items to provide actionable insights that can guide strategic decisions.

## Datasets Used

[Superstore.xls](https://1drv.ms/x/s!Avse_QetXnqFgYJ46rAtazD3bqPu5Q?e=xxxxxx): The primary dataset containing details about orders, products, customers, and returns.

## Project Objectives

1. **Profits & Losses**
   - Identify the top two profit centers and the top two loss-makers by region and product category.
   - Recommend products that the superstore should stop selling.
   - Suggest three product subcategories to focus on for growth and three to discontinue.

2. **Advertising**
   - Identify the best state-month combinations for advertising based on average profit per unit sold.
   - Determine the optimal advertising budget for the selected state-month combinations using a return on ad spend ratio.

3. **Returned Items**
   - Analyze the return rates of products and customers to identify patterns and areas for improvement.
   - Visualize the relationship between average profit and average return rate by state and customer segments.

## Data Visualizations

### Part 1: Profits & Losses

- **Visualization 1**: Profit Centers by Region  
  ![Profit Centers by Region](#)
  - *Explanation*: This visualization displays the profitability of different regions and product categories, highlighting the Central and East regions as key profit centers, while identifying underperforming areas in the West.

- **Visualization 2**: Products to Stop Selling  
  ![Products to Stop Selling](#)
  - *Explanation*: This chart highlights products that consistently generate losses, such as the GBC DocuBind P400 Electric, suggesting that the superstore should discontinue these items to improve overall profitability.

- **Visualization 3**: Subcategory Focus Areas  
  ![Subcategory Focus Areas](#)
  - *Explanation*: This visualization identifies the top three subcategories (Copiers, Phones, and Accessories) to focus on for maximizing profit, along with recommendations for discontinuing less profitable subcategories.

### Part 2: Advertising

- **Visualization 4**: Best State-Month Combinations for Advertising  
  ![State-Month Combinations](#)
  - *Explanation*: This heatmap highlights the most profitable state and month combinations for targeted advertising, recommending specific investments in states like Washington (March), Indiana (October), and Vermont (December) based on high returns.

### Part 3: Returned Items

- **Visualization 5**: Products with the Highest Return Rates  
  ![Highest Return Rates](#)
  - *Explanation*: This chart identifies products with high return rates, indicating potential quality issues that need to be addressed to reduce returns and improve customer satisfaction.

- **Visualization 6**: Customers with the Highest Return Rates  
  ![Customer Return Rates](#)
  - *Explanation*: This visualization pinpoints customers who frequently return items, allowing the superstore to address underlying issues and improve retention strategies.

- **Visualization 7**: Profit vs. Return Rate by State  
  ![Profit vs Return Rate](#)
  - *Explanation*: This scatter plot compares average profit with average return rates by state, providing insights into which regions are profitable and have manageable return rates, guiding strategic focus.

## Insights and Recommendations

### Profits & Losses
- **Recommendation 1**: Focus on high-performing regions (Central and East) and address underperformance in the West by optimizing product offerings.
- **Recommendation 2**: Discontinue loss-making products and emphasize profitable subcategories like Copiers, Phones, and Accessories.

### Advertising
- **Recommendation 3**: Invest in targeted advertising during the identified high-return periods and locations, ensuring an efficient use of the advertising budget.

### Returned Items
- **Recommendation 4**: Address quality or customer service issues associated with high-return products to reduce return rates and enhance customer satisfaction.
- **Recommendation 5**: Investigate customer segments with high return rates to identify patterns and mitigate future losses.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into the superstore's operations. By focusing on profitable areas, optimizing advertising strategies, and addressing return issues, the superstore can significantly improve its profitability and avoid potential bankruptcy.
