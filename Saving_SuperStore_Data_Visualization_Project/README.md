# Saving SuperStore - Data Visualization Project

## Project Overview

This project was completed using Tableau and focuses on analyzing the operations of a fictional superstore to increase its profitability and avoid bankruptcy. The project involves identifying profit and loss centers, assessing the value of advertising, and analyzing returned items to provide actionable insights.

## Datasets Used

[Superstore.xls](https://1drv.ms/x/s!Avse_QetXnqFgYJ46rAtazD3bqPu5Q?e=xxxxxx): The primary dataset containing details about orders, products, customers, and returns.

## Project Objectives

1. **Profits & Losses**
   - Identify the two biggest profit centers and the two biggest loss-makers.
   - Recommend products that the superstore should stop selling.
   - Suggest three product subcategories to focus on and three to stop selling.

2. **Advertising**
   - Identify the best combinations of states and months for advertising based on average profit per unit sold.
   - Determine the amount to be spent on advertising for the selected states and months, using a return on ad spend ratio.

3. **Returned Items**
   - Analyze the return rates of products and customers.
   - Create a visualization showing the relationship between average profit and average return rate on a chosen dimension.

  ![Highest Return Rates](link_to_image)
  - *Explanation*: This chart identifies products with abnormal return rates, indicating potential issues with quality or customer satisfaction.

- **Visualization 6**: Customers with the Highest Return Rates  
  ![Customer Return Rates](link_to_image)
  - *Explanation*: This visualization pinpoints customers who frequently return items, helping the store to address underlying issues.

- **Visualization 7**: Profit vs. Return Rate by [Chosen Dimension]  
  ![Profit vs Return Rate](link_to_image)
  - *Explanation*: This scatter plot compares the average profit to the average return rate across a chosen dimension, providing insights into whether the superstore should continue operating within that dimension.

## Insights and Recommendations

### Profits & Losses
- **Recommendation 1**: Focus on the identified profit centers and discontinue the major loss-makers.
- **Recommendation 2**: Stop selling products that consistently generate losses and focus on profitable subcategories.

### Advertising
- **Recommendation 3**: Invest in advertising in the identified state-month combinations, as these have the highest return potential.

### Returned Items
- **Recommendation 4**: Address quality or customer service issues with products that have high return rates.
- **Recommendation 5**: Evaluate customer segments with high return rates to identify patterns and mitigate future losses.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into the superstore's operations. By addressing the identified issues and capitalizing on profitable areas, the superstore can improve its profitability and avoid bankruptcy.
