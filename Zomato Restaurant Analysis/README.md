# Zomato Restaurant Analysis

## Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of restaurant performance using data from Zomato, a leading restaurant aggregator and food delivery service. The goal is to identify key factors contributing to the popularity and revenue of restaurants across various cities and cuisines. By understanding these dynamics, we aim to provide actionable insights that can help optimize restaurant operations and customer satisfaction.

## Research Questions

The analysis seeks to answer the following questions:
- Which restaurants have the highest number of customer visits?
- Which restaurants generate the highest revenue?
- What is the average customer rating for these restaurants?
- How does the location of a restaurant affect its popularity and revenue?
- What are the common characteristics of the top-performing restaurants?

## Hypotheses

The following hypotheses were tested during the analysis:
- Restaurants with higher customer ratings will have higher revenues.
- Restaurants in prime locations (e.g., city centers) are more popular and generate higher revenues.
- Certain cuisines are more popular and lead to higher revenues.
- There is a correlation between the average spend per customer and the overall revenue of the restaurant.

## Data Preparation

### Steps Taken:
- **Data Cleaning:** Ensured all datasets were free from null values and formatted correctly.
- **Data Merging:** Combined relevant datasets (food, menu, and restaurant data) to create a comprehensive dataset.
- **Calculated Fields:** Created fields such as average spend per customer, revenue per location, and popularity score.

## Metrics/Parameters for Analysis

The following metrics were investigated:
- **Popularity:** Number of customer visits, customer ratings.
- **Revenue:** Total revenue per restaurant, average spend per customer.
- **Restaurant Characteristics:** Cuisine type, location, price range.

## Data Visualization

Visualizations created to support the analysis include:
- **Bar Charts:** Number of customer visits by restaurant, total revenue by restaurant.
- **Heat Maps:** Customer ratings by restaurant location, revenue by location and cuisine type.
- **Scatter Plots:** Relationship between customer ratings and revenue.
- **Line Charts:** Revenue trends over time.
- **Drill-Down Tables:** Detailed revenue and visit statistics for the top 10 restaurants.

## Dashboard Layout

The dashboard created in Tableau is organized into the following sections:
- **Overview Section:** Key metrics, summary of the top 5 restaurants by revenue and visits.
- **Detailed Analysis Section:** Popularity analysis, revenue analysis, and correlation analysis with interactive filters.
- **Filter Options:** Date range, location, and cuisine type filters for focused analysis.

## Conclusion

The Zomato restaurant analysis highlighted key trends and opportunities in the restaurant industry. By focusing on top-performing cities, popular cuisines, and both chain and non-chain restaurants, stakeholders can make informed decisions to drive growth and customer satisfaction. This analysis serves as a roadmap for strategic planning and operational excellence in the dynamic world of the restaurant industry.
